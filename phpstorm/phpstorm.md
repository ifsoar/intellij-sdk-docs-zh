title: PhpStorm Plugin Development
---

Plugins for PhpStorm are developed in Java using IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition is sufficient in this case). You will also need a copy of PhpStorm to develop against. The [PsiViewer plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer) will also be useful.

### PhpStorm Specifics

* [Setting-up the environment](setting_up_environment.md)
* [PHP Open API](php_open_api.md)
* [Existing 3rd party plugins](existing_plugins.md)
