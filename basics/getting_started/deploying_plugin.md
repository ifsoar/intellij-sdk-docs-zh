title: Deploying a Plugin
---

Before your custom plugin can be used, it must be deployed: built, installed, and then enabled using Plugin Manager.

To deploy a plugin:

* Make your project by invoking **Build \| Make Project**.
* Prepare your plugin for deployment. In the main menu, select **Build \| Prepare Plugin Module '\<module name\>' for Deployment**.

* If the plugin module does not depend on any libraries, a `.jar` archive will be created. Otherwise, a `.zip` archive will be created including all the plugin libraries specified in the project settings.

* Copy the newly created archive file to the `.IntelliJIDEAx0\config\plugins` folder, and then restart your IDE so the changes may take effect.  To know how to locate your *plugins* directory, refer to [IDE Settings, Caches, Logs, and Plugins](/basics/settings_caches_logs.md).

* In the main menu, select **File \| Settings** to open the Settings dialog box.
* In the Settings dialog box, under **IDE Settings**, click **Plugins**.
* In the Plugins area, open the **Installed** tab, and then select the check-box next to your plugin name.
* When finished, click OK to close the Settings dialog box.
* Restart the IDE so that your changes take effect.
