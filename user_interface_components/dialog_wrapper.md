## DialogWrapper

The
[DialogWrapper](upsource:///platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/DialogWrapper.java)
is the base class which is supposed to be used for all modal dialogs (and some non-modal dialogs) shown in *IntelliJ Platform* plugins.
It provides the following features:

*  Button layout (platform-specific order of `OK/Cancel` buttons, Mac OS-specific `Help` button)

*  Context help

*  Remembering the size of the dialog

*  Non-modal validation (displaying an error message text when the data entered into the dialog is not valid)

*  Keyboard shortcuts

    *  `Esc` for closing the dialog

    *   `Left/Right` for switching between buttons

    *   `Y/N` for `Yes/No` actions if they exist in the dialog

*  Optional `Do not ask again` checkbox


When using the
[DialogWrapper](upsource:///platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/DialogWrapper.java)
class for your own dialog, you need to follow these steps:

*  Call the base class constructor and provide either a project in the frame of which the dialog will be displayed, or a parent component for the dialog.

*  Call the `init()` method from the constructor of your dialog class

*  Call the `setTitle()` method to set the title for the dialog box

*  Implement the `createCenterPanel()` method to return the component comprising the main contents of the dialog.

*  *Optional*: Override the `getPreferredFocusedComponent()` method and return the component that should be focused when the dialog is first displayed.

*  *Optional*: Override the `getDimensionServiceKey()` method to return the identifier which will be used for persisting the dialog dimensions.

*  *Optional*: Override the `getHelpId()` method to return the context help topic associated with the dialog.

The
[DialogWrapper](upsource:///platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/DialogWrapper.java)
class is often used together with UI Designer forms.
In this case, you bind a UI Designer form to your class extending
[DialogWrapper](upsource:///platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/DialogWrapper.java),
bind the top-level panel of the form to a field and return that field from the `createCenterPanel()` method.

To display the dialog, you call the `show()` method and then use the `getExitCode()` method to check how the dialog was closed.

To customize the buttons displayed in the dialog (replacing the standard `OK/Cancel/Help` set of buttons), you can override either the `createActions()` or `createLeftActions()` methods.
Both of these methods return an array of Swing Action objects.
If the button that you're adding closes the dialog, you can use
[DialogWrapperExitAction](upsource:///platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/DialogWrapper.java),
as the base class for your action.

To validate the data entered into the dialog, you can override the `doValidate()` method.
The method will be called automatically by timer.
If the currently entered data is valid, you need to return `null` from your implementation.
Otherwise, you need to return a
[ValidationInfo](upsource:///platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/ValidationInfo.java)
class which encapsulates an error message and an optional component associated with the invalid data.
If you specify a component, an error icon will be displayed next to it, and it will be focused when the user tries to invoke the `OK` action.
